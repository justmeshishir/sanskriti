A simple interpreter build using GO language.

## Notice
This is one of my ambious project. The languge is on under development. I am trying to find some time actually to write code. If anyone wants to contribute everyone is free to contribute. Else you can always mail me and encourage me to build this project. Hope this project does not get's dumped and sees the morning light. God help me on this journey.
